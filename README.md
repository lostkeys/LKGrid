# LKGrid

This is a basic SCSS grid component that works for me. Maybe for you too. Try it out.

## Usage

The grid framework is found in `sass/_grid-framework.scss`. All other files are basically only to make the demo work.

Inside `sass/_docs.scss` you'll find how to use the grid.

`index.html` contains a simple test page.
